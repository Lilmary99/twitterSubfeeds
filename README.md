# twitterSubfeeds
This project implements a new feature we suggested for the desktop site of twitter called subfeeds.The goal is to connect Twitter users with other users that care about the same interests/"categories" as they are. So, for someone who visits an indivdual's profle on Twitter and hopes to better understand their interests, they can go to the subfeeds tab. On this tab, a list of no more than 5 catergories derived from a combination of parsing the user's tweets and validated by the user shows up. When each button on the page that holds each category is active/clicked,the tweets from the user's metadata that have been identified with that category will show up directly under it.
